GoToVelocity is a Velcocity plugin that adds the /goto command, that teleport you from a server to another (previously only feasible with [GoTo System](https://github.com/L3gendYTs/GoTo-System))

## Download
You can download the plugin from the [Releases](https://github.com/PokeMichele/GoTo-Velocity/releases) or from [PaperMC Hangar](https://hangar.papermc.io/IlSommo/GoTo-Velocity)

## Configuration
In the "config.toml" file you can customize the messages. Here is how it appears by default:

    #GoTo Velocity by PokeMichele - Il Sommo
    [messages]
    run-from-player = "You can't run this command from the console!"
    no-permission = "Sorry, you don't have the permission to do that"
    must-specify-server = "You must specify a Server Name"
    server-not-found = "Server not found"

## Permission
- gotovelocity.goto

## Credits & License
GoTo Velocity is a reworked version of the [GoTo System](https://github.com/L3gendYTs/GoTo-System) (only available for BungeeCord and its forks) for Velocity and it's not related in any way to the original project, as the codebase is completely different. What the 2 projects share is the idea of the /goto command usable through the Proxy.
